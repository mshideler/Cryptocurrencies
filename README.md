# Cryptocurrencies

The purpose of this project was to use unsupervised learning to be able to provide Martha, one of our clients, an analysis of cryptocurrency so Martha can present to the Accountability Accounting board this information so they can explore the possibility of adding a cryptocurrency investment portfolio.
